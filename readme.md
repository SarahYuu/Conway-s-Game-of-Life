Notes (certain design choices)
1. At the start of the game, the "Block" button is selected by default.
2. After a user clicks the "Clear" button, they need to reselect shapes in order to draw shapes again. 

This supports a manual mode (pause and resume functionality), where the user can single-step through the animation
(Use the key "M" to toggle between manual mode and the animation mode)
(Use the key "N" to advance to the next frame
